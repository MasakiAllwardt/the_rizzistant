# Letta AI Integration Summary

## Overview

The Rizzistant now uses **Letta AI** for intelligent, persistent memory management across all dates. Each user gets their own Letta agent that remembers ALL past dates and provides increasingly personalized coaching over time.

## What Changed

### Architecture Before
- Claude 3.5 Haiku for real-time warnings ✅ (kept)
- Claude 3.5 Haiku for post-date summaries ❌ (replaced)
- SQLite stores only the last date summary
- OMI receives final summaries ❌ (replaced)

### Architecture After
- Claude 3.5 Haiku for real-time warnings ✅ (kept)
- **Letta agents for post-date summaries** ✨ (NEW)
- SQLite stores the last date summary (for backward compatibility)
- **Letta manages all historical memory** ✨ (NEW)

## Key Benefits

### 1. Persistent Memory Across All Dates
- Each user has a dedicated Letta agent
- Agent remembers EVERY date, not just the last one
- Tracks patterns and progress over time

### 2. Intelligent Historical Context
- "This is your 5th date - you've improved on X but still struggle with Y"
- "You tend to talk about CS when nervous (happened on 3 previous dates)"
- "Compared to your best date (#3), you did better on..."

### 3. Personalized Learning
- Agent actively updates its memory about the user
- Learns user's strengths, weaknesses, and patterns
- Provides increasingly tailored advice

### 4. No Manual State Management
- Letta handles all memory persistence server-side
- No more SQLite juggling for historical context
- Agents continue existing even when app restarts

## Files Modified

### 1. `requirements.txt`
Added: `letta-client`

### 2. `app/config.py`
```python
# Added Letta client initialization
from letta_client import Letta

def get_letta_client():
    """Get initialized Letta API client"""
    return Letta(token=os.environ.get("LETTA_API_KEY"))

LETTA_API_KEY = os.environ.get("LETTA_API_KEY")
```

### 3. `app/services.py`
Added complete `LettaService` class with:
- `get_or_create_agent(user_id)` - Lazy agent creation per user
- `process_date_end(user_id, transcript, previous_summary)` - Generate summaries with full historical context

**Agent Configuration:**
- Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective, fast)
- Memory blocks:
  - **human**: User profile, dating goals (updated by agent)
  - **persona**: The Rizzistant coach identity
- No tools (focused on conversation analysis)

### 4. `app/main.py`
Replaced **2 locations** where summaries are generated:
- **Line 85-100**: Emergency exit (code word) → Uses Letta
- **Line 131-149**: Normal "end date" command → Uses Letta

### 5. `.env.example`
Added:
```bash
# Letta AI Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://cloud.letta.com
LETTA_API_KEY=your_letta_api_key_here
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Letta API Key
1. Go to https://cloud.letta.com
2. Sign up or log in
3. Generate an API key

### 2. Add to Environment
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
LETTA_API_KEY=letta_****************************
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Restart the Server
```bash
make dev
```

## How It Works

### First Date for a User
1. User says "end date"
2. LettaService checks if agent exists for user → No
3. Creates new Letta agent with:
   - User ID in memory
   - Dating coach persona
   - Empty historical context
4. Sends transcript to agent
5. Agent generates summary (no historical comparison yet)
6. Agent stores transcript in its archival memory

### Subsequent Dates
1. User says "end date"
2. LettaService checks if agent exists for user → Yes, retrieves agent_id
3. Sends transcript to existing agent
4. **Agent automatically recalls ALL previous dates**
5. Agent generates summary comparing to ALL past dates
6. Agent updates its memory blocks with new patterns
7. Agent stores new transcript in archival memory

### Memory Blocks Example

After 3 dates, the agent's "human" block might evolve to:
```
User ID: user_12345
Dating goals: Find meaningful connection, improve confidence
Strengths: Good sense of humor, asks thoughtful questions
Weaknesses: Talks about CS/tech when nervous, interrupts when excited
Patterns: Dates go better when discussing travel, hobbies, food
Current focus: Active listening, topic transitions
```

## What Stays the Same

✅ Real-time conversation monitoring (Claude Haiku)
✅ Warning system for problematic topics
✅ "Yeah okay so" conversation tip generation
✅ Emergency exit code word
✅ Twilio phone calls
✅ Start/end date commands
✅ SQLite database (for backward compatibility)

## Testing the Integration

To test with a sample date:

1. Start the server: `make dev`
2. Send a "start date" command
3. Send some transcript segments
4. Send "end date" command
5. Check logs for:
   - `Created new Letta agent {agent_id} for user {user_id}`
   - `Generated date summary for user {uid} via Letta agent {agent_id}`
   - `Saved new summary to database for user {uid}`

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 2: ChromaDB RAG
- Store all transcripts in ChromaDB vector database
- Enable semantic search across all dates
- Letta agent can query: "Find examples where user successfully changed topics"
- Provides concrete examples from past dates

### Phase 3: Advanced Tools
Give Letta agent tools to:
- Search past transcripts for patterns
- Generate personalized improvement plans
- Track specific goals over time

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent
- Different agents for different coaching aspects
- Dating strategy agent
- Conversation flow agent
- Emotional intelligence agent

## Notes

- Agent IDs are stored in memory (`user_agents` dict)
- In production, store user→agent_id mapping in database
- SQLite still used for backward compatibility
- OMI integration removed (Letta replaces it)
- All real-time features unchanged (speed-critical)

## Troubleshooting

**"Unable to generate date summary - Letta agent unavailable"**
- Check LETTA_API_KEY is set in .env
- Verify API key is valid at https://cloud.letta.com
- Check server logs for detailed error messages

**"Error creating Letta agent"**
- Ensure letta-client is installed: `pip install letta-client`
- Check API quota/limits in Letta dashboard
- Verify network connectivity to cloud.letta.com

**Agent memory not persisting**
- Agent memory persists on Letta's servers automatically
- `user_agents` mapping resets on app restart (store in DB for production)
- Each user gets a unique agent that persists forever

## API Reference

### LettaService Methods

```python
# Get or create agent for a user
agent_id = letta_service.get_or_create_agent(user_id="user_123")

# Process date end and generate summary
summary = letta_service.process_date_end(
    user_id="user_123",
    transcript="Full date transcript...",
    previous_summary="Optional: last date summary for context"
)
```

## Cost Estimates

Using `gpt-4o-mini` model:
- Input: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$0.60 per 1M tokens

Typical date summary (~2000 input tokens, ~500 output tokens):
- Cost per date: ~$0.0006 (less than 1 cent)
- 1000 dates: ~$0.60

**Much cheaper than repeatedly re-analyzing full history!**
